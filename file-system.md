* The **home folder of the root user** (administrator).
* Different from `/` (the root directory).

* Stores **temporary runtime data** (like process IDs, sockets).
* Gets cleared after reboot.
* Think of it as the **scratchpad for running programs**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ `sbin`

* Like `/bin`, but contains **system administration commands**.
* Example: `reboot`, `fdisk`, `ifconfig`.
* Think of it as the **toolbox for mechanics (admins)**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ `srv`

* Contains **data served by the system** (like websites or FTP).
* Rarely used on desktops.
* Think of it as the **storefront** for services.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ `tmp`

* Temporary files go here.
* Cleared on reboot.
* Think of it as the **scratch paper** bin.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ `usr`

* Contains **user programs and libraries**.

* Example: `/var/log/syslog` (system logs).
* Think of it as the **diary/journal of the system**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Special merged folders:

* `bin.usr-is-merged`, `sbin.usr-is-merged`, `lib.usr-is-merged`

  * These are **Ubuntuâ€™s way of merging `/bin` with `/usr/bin`, `/sbin` with `/usr/sbin`, etc.**
  * Theyâ€™re basically **links** for backward compatibility. You donâ€™t usually need to worry about them.

---
