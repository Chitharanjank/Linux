# 🔐 Understanding the Shadow File (Password & Account Status)

## What is `/etc/shadow`?

* Stores **encrypted passwords**
* Contains **password expiration info**
* Only accessible by **root**

---

## View Shadow File (Root Only)

```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

---

## Format of `/etc/shadow`

Example entry:

```
username:$6$abc123xyz$hashedpassword:19000:0:99999:7:::
```

It contains 9 fields separated by `:`

```
username:password:lastchg:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:reserved
```

## 🔎 How to Check If Password is Set or Not

### If password field contains:

* `!!` → User has **no password set**
* `!` at beginning → Account is **locked**
* `$6$...` → Password is set (hashed)

Example:

```
john:!!:...
```

👉 Password NOT set

```
john:!$6$abc123...
```

👉 Account LOCKED

```
john:$6$abc123...
```

👉 Password is SET and account is active
